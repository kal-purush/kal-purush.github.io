title: "Chakriguru: A job portal for illiterate people"

description: In urban area, mainly economically challenged people are those who have little or no education and hardly have any access to existing technologies. Apart from their physical labor they have little to offer as their skill levels are typically very low. So, often it is very hard to find appropriate jobs for them. On top of that whatever job they can get may not be safe or secured. And as they cant easily access mobile technologies (e.g using smartphone) they are basically detached from the huge opportunity that internet today can provide. We tried to find a way to break this technology barrier. We interviewed  around 35 people from different occupations and classes to find out what they expect from a job portal. We gathered a lot of insights from their experience and tried to build a noble system which can serve these people properly. We participated in the Brac Urban Urban Innovation Challenge with this project and was able to reach the semifinal of the competition."
