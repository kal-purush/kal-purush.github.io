title: "Sentiment Analysis of Reader’s Comments in ESPNcricinfo: An Empirical Study"

description: "Sports news websites, like ESPNCricinfo, has become very popular nowadays, through which users can easily get updated about ongoing games, and express their opinions and enthusiasm about sports. The massive amount of user comments is a useful source that carries mass sentiment and opinions towards the game. There is no previous research on classifying sentiment of user’s comment in sports domain especially on ESPNCricinfo which is based on the game of cricket. In this work, we use a sentiment analysis algorithm and a lexical analysis tool to investigate the influence of various factors such as players form, type of the game,or even the time of the day on sentiments in the context of ESPNCricinfo. We start our analysis by looking at direct correlations, e.g.,we observe more positive sentiments on during the good form period of a player,weekends,more sentiment on the 4th day of a test match than others day.We then extend this basic analysis by investigating how team combination(visitor, host)pair affect the sentiment present in the comment.We also show that user’s sentiment differ for the same pair of team in different format of the game. The main contribution of this paper is the idea of using sentiment analysis to identify the major factors influencing user sentiments because we believe that understanding factors influencing the mood of users has interesting applications in advertising, recommendation, and search engine optimization.
