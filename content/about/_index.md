Welcome to my homepage. I am a Ph.D. candidate at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, advised by [Cristian-Alexandru Staicu](https://www.staicu.org/). I obtained my Master's degree from the University of Nevada, Reno, USA, under the supervision of Engin Arslan. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology. You can check my complete CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hGm9GjBVtWHB-c24Kv_bl_TiBYd6HW0H/view?usp=sharing). 

My core research interest is in program security at the intersection of software/web security, software engineering, and programming languages. One of my research goals is to secure the open-source ecosystem by building program analysis tools to enhance programmer productivity and uncover new security vulnerabilities. My current research focuses on developing machine learning models to improve Static Call Graph techniques for Server-side JavaScript applications.
